# DataBreach

_Team: Cyril Keller, David Polke, Andreas Kohler, Elia Salerno_

DataBreach is an audio game in which you have to defend yourself against virtual viruses. You have to quickly recognise sounds coming from one of the eight surrounding speakers and react to them by turning a cube in the direction of the corresponding sound source to collect points. The aim of this game is to sharpen your hearing and reflexes.
